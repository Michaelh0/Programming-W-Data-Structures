Computer Science 124 class work at Ohlone College

This course involves the study and implementation of data structure programming techniques. The emphasis is on the data structures of stacks, queues, lists, trees, and hash tables; the use of recursion; and the application of these tools primarily to searching and sorting. Students implement these concepts by writing programs in an object-oriented language such as C.
